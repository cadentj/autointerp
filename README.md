# autointerp

Simple, hackable implementation of automated interpretability.

- [Cache](https://github.com/cadentj/autointerp/blob/master/demo/cache.py)
- [Explain](https://github.com/cadentj/autointerp/blob/master/demo/explain.py)
- [Score](https://github.com/cadentj/autointerp/blob/master/demo/score.py)

Todo:
- [ ] Caching and loading does not support padding at the moment.
- [ ] Make a simple unified client like [safety-tooling](https://github.com/safety-research/safety-tooling).
