Quantization involves reducing the precision of the model's weights and activations, which can reduce the amount of memory required to store the model. Pruning involves removing redundant connections in the model, which can reduce the number of computations required to train the model. Distributed training involves dividing the model into smaller parts and training them on different machines, which can speed up the training process.\n\nIn addition to these techniques\nExample 5: ating new patterns.\n2.

Domain-specific pre-training: By training the model on specific domains, such as medical or financial data, you can help the model learn the relevant language patterns and reduce the chances of hallucinating new patterns.\n5.

They can be used to make predictions about future events or outcomes based on the patterns and relationships they have learned from the training data.\n\nFor example, an LLM could be trained on historical weather data to predict future weather patterns, or it could be trained on medical records to predict the likelihood of certain diseases or outcomes.

The traditional approach to identifying atrial fibrillation relies on manual analysis of electrocardiograms (ECGs), which is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise.

With 175 billion parameters, the number of neurons could be in the order of a few hundred million or more.\n\nHowever, it\'s important to note that the number of neurons isn\'t the only factor that determines the model\'s performance.
