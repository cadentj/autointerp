system


We're studying neurons in a neural network.
Each neuron looks for some particular thing in a short document.
Look at summary of what the neuron does, and try to predict how it will fire on each token.

The activation format is token<tab>activation, activations go from 0 to 10, "unknown" indicates an unknown activation. Most activations will be 0.
